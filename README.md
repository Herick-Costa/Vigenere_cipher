4 - Enter the encryption key when prompted.
5 - The script will encrypt the message using the Vigenère cipher and display the encrypted message.

##What is the Vigenère Cipher?
The Vigenère cipher is a method of encryption that uses a series of different Caesar ciphers based on letters of a keyword. It was invented by the French cryptographer Blaise de Vigenère in the 16th century. The Vigenère cipher is more secure than simple substitution ciphers like the Caesar cipher because it alters the letters of the message according to a keyword.
